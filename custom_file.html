    <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">At Yuno we care about the security of our accesses,
            so we generated this campaign to raise awareness about Phishing attacks. <strong>This was a drill</strong>,
            so the
            Credentials you entered were not stored anywhere, nor was there any change to your productive
            credentials.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers
            trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial data. It
            often comes in the form of emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate but are actually designed to
            steal your information.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To protect yourself from phishing:</span></p>

    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Always verify the sender's email address. Be cautious of emails from unknown or suspicious senders.
            <ul>
                <li>Did you notice the email sender is linkedin@notifications.solutions? Known enterprises, like LinkedIn, typically use .com domains with their company name in the address. They often reserve these domains to prevent phishing attempts. For instance, LinkedIn would likely use an email address ending in "@linkedin.com" for official communications.</li>
        </ul>
        </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Hover over links before clicking on them to see the actual URL they will redirect you to. Avoid clicking on links from unfamiliar sources.
            <ul>
                <li>When you clicked on any of the links in the email, you were redirected to https://notifications.solutions/. This should raise concerns since the page appears to be a LinkedIn login page, but it does not actually belong to LinkedIn. Good catch noticing the use of the HTTPS protocol! However, be aware that if the HTTP protocol had been used, it should also have triggered a warning due to the insecure connection, especially if credentials were being requested.</li>
            </ul>
        </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Check the context of the email. Be wary of emails that create a sense of urgency or ask for sensitive information.
                <ul>
                    <li>Did it sound familiar to you an employee working for Yuno named Nataschia de Boer that lives in Belgium?</li>
                </ul>
            </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you suspect an email or message is phishing, report it to your IT or security team immediately.
        </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We ask that you do not tell your colleagues about
            this drill so that our metrics are as accurate as possible. In the next few days
            you will be receiving an email asking you to take mandatory training on Phishing so you can
            be prepared in case a real Phishing case appears.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">With love, Secops Team </span><span
